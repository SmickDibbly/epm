* T-junctions
- Detection not working yet, so can't go about fixing them.


* Leafy BSP
- Leaf-condition: Instead of "all planes in the subset are coplanar" indicating
  a stopping point, do "the planes in the subset all lie on the boundary of the
  convex hull. I believe this can checked merely by ensuring that for each
  polygon P in the subset, all other polygons Q in the subset are on the same
  side of P or coplanar with P.

  
* Raster faster
** Perspective-correct vertex attribute interpolation.
- Do perspective-correct texture mapping every n-th pixel (likely want n = 8,
  16, or 32) instead of every pixel, and interpolate between.
